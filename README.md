## 📂 Main Projects

### 📡 Antenna Design Simulation and Constructions
- Design of patch antennas [Patch antenna B7 LTE](https://github.com/Merituum/patch2600LTE)<br>
- Log-periodic antennas [LPDA for LTE (B1, B3, B7)](https://github.com/Merituum/LPDA_1.8-2.6GHz)<br>
- Currently working on a beam steering system for communication with the ISS [ISS Project](https://github.com/Merituum/ISSproject)<br>
Repository is hidden since paper about this project is about to be published.

### 📶 MNSM - BTS Map with Azimuth Displaying
Python application that displays a map with mobile stations in Poland along with the azimuths of their antennas - [MNSM - link](https://github.com/Merituum/mnsm_BTS_map)  
**Technologies used:**
- Python
- Pandas
- QT
- Folium

### 📱 LTE and 5G Simulations
Simulation of a 4G network in my hometown, Łomża (T-Mobile only), with real-life results comparison - [NetWorks - Lomza](https://github.com/Merituum/FekoLomza) <br>
Currently working on a 5G simulation in the center of Warsaw - [WWA_5G](https://github.com/Merituum/wwa_cen_5G)
